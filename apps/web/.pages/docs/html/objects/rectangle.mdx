## What is Rectangle (Rect)\*\*?

A rectangle? It's just a square that's been stretched out sideways, like a balloon animal on a diet. Still confused check the output of the given code.

<Callout title="Please note">
  Its not `fabric.Rectangle` it's `fabric.Rect`. So make sure to use correct one
  to avoid errors.

### Adding first rectangle

```html title="index.html" output=true {2-19}
<body>
  <canvas
    id="c"
    width="200"
    style="border: 1px solid black"
    height="200"
  ></canvas>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fabric@latest/dist/fabric.js"></script>
  <script>
    let canvas = new fabric.Canvas("c");
    let rect = new fabric.Rect({
      left: 0,
      top: 0,
      fill: "red",
      width: 100,
      height: 150,
    });
    canvas.add(rect);
  </script>
</body>
```

### Rotating a rectangle

Oh! so our rectangle is ready. Now lets play a little more with it. Let's just **Rotate** it a little bit.

```html title="index.html" output=true  {17}
<body>
  <canvas
    id="c"
    width="200"
    style="border: 1px solid black"
    height="200"
  ></canvas>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fabric@latest/dist/fabric.js"></script>
  <script>
    let canvas = new fabric.Canvas("c");
    let rect = new fabric.Rect({
      left: 50,
      top: 50,
      fill: "red",
      width: 75,
      height: 50,
      angle: 45,
    });
    canvas.add(rect);
  </script>
</body>
```

<Callout title="Getting properties">
  Using method `rect.get()` will also help you to get the current of value of
  that property. like using `rect.get('angle')` will give us 45 from the above
  example.
