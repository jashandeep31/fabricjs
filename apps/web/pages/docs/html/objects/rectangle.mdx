## Why Fabric JS

Fabric.js simplifies `HTML5` canvas manipulation with an npm package. Unlike the low-level canvas API, Fabric.js offers a high-level object model for intuitive graphic creation and manipulation. It manages canvas state and rendering, enabling direct object interaction instead of manual bitmap modification. This makes it ideal for interactive web apps and complex graphics.
